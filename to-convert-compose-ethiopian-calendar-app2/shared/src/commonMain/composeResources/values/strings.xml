    <string name="holiday_public_enkutatash">Enkutatash</string>
    <string name="holiday_public_enkutatash_history">Enkutatash is the Ethiopian New Year and is celebrated on Meskerem 1. The name translates to &quot;Gift of Jewels,&quot; and one source links it to the pearl gift Queen of Sheba received from King Solomon, who said, &quot;May a pearl be a jewel for your finger,&quot; after her visit. Another view suggests it comes from Ham, the son of Noah, who, upon entering the land of Africa and seeing it adorned with Adey Ababa, exclaimed, &quot;I have been allotted a jewel.&quot; Meskerem signifies the end of the rainy season and the beginning of the spring season (Tseday).</string>
    <string name="holiday_public_enkutatash_celebration">The main tradition is the exchange of New Year cards and bouquets of bright yellow Adey Ababa daisies, which symbolize the transition from the dark season to a vibrant, flower-filled landscape. Girls go from house to house singing traditional songs, collecting money and fresh bread. At the family level, the holiday includes eating Doro Wot (spicy chicken stew) and the ceremonial slaughter of a sheep or goat.</string>

    <string name="holiday_public_christian_meskel">Meskel</string>
    <string name="holiday_public_christian_meskel_history">Meskel is an annual festival commemorating the finding of the True Cross upon which Jesus Christ was crucified, through the efforts of Empress Helena in the 4th century. It is celebrated on Meskerem 17 and is one of the most vibrant and colorful festivals of the Orthodox Christians.</string>
    <string name="holiday_public_christian_meskel_celebration">The main ceremony is called Demera, which primarily takes place at Meskel Square in Addis Ababa, involving priests, deacons, and a large crowd dressed in traditional white clothing. After sunset, the Demera bonfire is lit. The light of the bonfire symbolizes the smoke that guided Empress Helena to the location of the Cross. (Additionally, the direction in which the ashes fall is interpreted by priests to predict the prospects for the coming year.)</string>

    <string name="holiday_public_christian_genna">Genna</string>
    <string name="holiday_public_christian_genna_history">Genna is observed on Tahsas 29 (Tahsas 28 once every four years). Unlike the commercial aspect of the holiday celebrated in the Western world, Genna is primarily a religious observance, following the 40-day Fast of the Prophets by Orthodox believers, a period of abstaining from all meat and dairy products. The holiday concludes the long fast by consuming meat and dairy products on the morning of Genna.</string>
    <string name="holiday_public_christian_genna_celebration">A popular tradition associated with Genna is the game of Yegenna Chewata. This is a traditional hockey-like game played by men with a bent stick and a ball. (Legend states the game was played by the shepherds after the birth of Christ.)</string>

    <string name="holiday_public_christian_timket">Timket</string>
    <string name="holiday_public_christian_timket_history">Timket (Epiphany) is a vibrant celebration by Christian followers, especially the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, commemorating the baptism of Jesus Christ by John the Baptist in the Jordan River. The story of Jesus Christ\'s baptism is found in the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 3, verses 13–17.</string>
    <string name="holiday_public_christian_timket_celebration">On Tikimt 10, the Tabots (replicas of the Ark of the Covenant) are carried out of their respective churches and proceed, accompanied by the faithful singing, to the celebration site. There, they are housed in prepared tents and spend the night. At the site, flowing water is contained in rural areas, and artificial reservoirs are built in cities. On Tikimt 11, the day of Timket; at dawn, the faithful receive communion around the tents, and after they finish, led by the priests, everyone heads to the reservoir, where the water is blessed and the people are sprinkled. Following this ceremony, the Tabots are escorted back to their respective churches with religious hymns accompanied by *Mekwamiye* (prayer staffs), *Kebero* (drums), and *Tsinatsil* (sistras), with men shouting in celebration (*Hota*), women ululating (*Ellilta*), and priests chanting *Haleta*.</string>

    <string name="holiday_public_adwa">Adwa Victory Day</string>
    <string name="holiday_public_adwa_history">The Battle of Adwa, fought on Yekatit 23, 1888 E.C., between the Ethiopian army led by Emperor Menelik II and the Italian army that crossed the sea from Europe, is one of the most significant events in history. The Adwa battle commemorates Ethiopia\'s victory over the invading Italian forces. This historic triumph is celebrated as one of the greatest acts of resistance against colonial aggression in Africa. The main cause of the Battle of Adwa was the Treaty of Wuchale signed between the Ethiopian and Italian governments. After the army led by Emperor Menelik reached Adwa, they waited for a favorable time for the battle, and on Yekatit 23, 1888 E.C., they engaged in battle with the European force that had mobilized over 17,000 soldiers. Within half a day of the battle\'s start, the Ethiopian patriots inflicted heavy damage on the Italian army with attacks launched from all directions, preventing them from grouping together to resist the Ethiopians. The Adwa Victory was first celebrated in its seventh year, in 1895 E.C. (in 1903, one hundred and nine years ago, at the place where St. George\'s Church now stands, which was Menelik Square).</string>
    <string name="holiday_public_adwa_celebration">The day is marked across the country, especially in Addis Ababa and Adwa memorial sites, with national celebrations, military parades, and ceremonial events. This day serves as a memorial that recalls national unity, sovereignty, and the historical struggle for freedom, distinguishing Ethiopia as the only African country to have defeated a major European power on the battlefield and maintained its independence.</string>

    <string name="holiday_public_labour_day">Labour Day</string>
    <string name="holiday_public_labour_day_history">Labour Day, or International Workers\' Day, is observed globally and celebrated in Ethiopia on Miyazya 23. This public holiday recognizes the contributions and achievements of workers and the labour movement. The day is dedicated to the social and economic rights of workers and is often accompanied by discussions, rallies, and organized events by trade unions.</string>
    <string name="holiday_public_labour_day_celebration">While generally recognized as a day off for most citizens, the observance of Labour Day in Ethiopia follows the international tradition of highlighting worker solidarity and the ongoing effort for fair labour practices and improved working conditions. The day is used to reflect on the progress made in protecting workers\' rights and the economic contributions of the labour force.</string>

    <string name="holiday_public_patriots_day">Patriots\' Day</string>
    <string name="holiday_public_patriots_day_history">Patriots\' Day, celebrated on Miyazya 27, commemorates the liberation of Ethiopia from the five-year Italian occupation (1936–1941) and to honor the sacrifices of the resistance fighters, or &quot;Patriots.&quot; This day marks the return of Emperor Haile Selassie to Addis Ababa in 1941, signaling the end of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and the restoration of national sovereignty.</string>
    <string name="holiday_public_patriots_day_celebration">The celebration involves laying wreaths at monuments dedicated to the war heroes and martyrs across Ethiopia. It is a deeply patriotic occasion that emphasizes national pride, resilience, and the unity of the Ethiopian people in their struggle against foreign invaders. The day serves as a solemn remembrance of those who fought and died for the country\'s freedom.</string>

    <string name="holiday_derg">Derg Downfall Day</string>
    <string name="holiday_derg_history">Derg Downfall Day, observed on Genbot 20, commemorates the overthrow of the Derg military junta in 1991 E.C. (1991), which marked the end of a 17-year period of Marxist-Leninist military rule. The Derg regime, which came to power after deposing Emperor Haile Selassie I, was characterized by political repression, famine, and civil war.</string>
    <string name="holiday_derg_celebration">This day is celebrated as a major turning point in Ethiopia\'s history, ushering in a new political structure and the hope for democracy and peace for many. While it is a public holiday and historically commemorates the liberation from the dictatorship, its observance and interpretation remain a subject of varied public discourse regarding the country\'s ongoing political developments.</string>

    <!-- ============================================ -->
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_siklet">Siklet (Good Friday)</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_siklet_history">Siklet, which translates to "Crucifixion," is the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo observance of Good Friday. It commemorates the suffering, crucifixion, and death of Jesus Christ at Calvary. This day falls during the most solemn part of the Holy Week, following 55 days of rigorous Lenten fasting, known as Abiy Tsom.</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_siklet_celebration">On Siklet, the faithful engage in a full day of fasting and attend special, lengthy church services that recount the events leading up to the crucifixion. The atmosphere is intensely sorrowful and meditative, with many worshipers prostrating themselves in prayer. The day is a profound reflection on sacrifice and preparation for the joy of Fasika (Easter).</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_fasika">Fasika (Easter)</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_fasika_history">Fasika, the Ethiopian Orthodox Easter, is the most important holiday in the liturgical calendar, celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Because the Ethiopian Orthodox Church follows the Julian calendar, Fasika typically falls later than Easter celebrated by Western churches. It is the joyous culmination of the seven-week Great Lent (Abiy Tsom).</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_fasika_celebration">The celebration begins after an all-night vigil that ends around 3:00 am on Easter Sunday. Following the church service, the people break their long fast with a massive feast, typically featuring meat dishes like Doro Wot (chicken stew) and Kitfo (raw or lightly cooked ground beef). Unlike Western traditions, there are no Easter bunnies, but the day is filled with festive singing, dancing, and family gatherings.</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_tensae">Tensae (Resurrection)</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_tensae_history">Tensae, meaning Resurrection, is closely tied to Fasika and refers specifically to the moment of Jesus Christ\'s rising from the dead, which is the core theological event celebrated at Easter. While often used interchangeably with Fasika, Tensae highlights the spiritual triumph over death. It marks the shift from the somber fasting period to immense religious joy.</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_tensae_celebration">The liturgy of the Resurrection is characterized by jubilant chanting, processions, and the use of the sistrum (a percussion instrument) by the priests, symbolizing the angels singing. The significance of Tensae is reflected in the traditional greetings exchanged among the faithful, emphasizing the divine victory and the promise of eternal life.</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_erget">Erget (Ascension)</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_erget_history">Erget, or the Feast of the Ascension, commemorates the biblical account of Jesus Christ\'s bodily ascension into heaven 40 days after his resurrection on Fasika. This movable feast marks the final earthly appearance of Christ before his disciples and serves as the bridge between his resurrection and the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_erget_celebration">The day is celebrated with special church services and hymns focused on Christ\'s enthronement in heaven and his continued spiritual presence among his followers. Although a solemn religious observance, it carries a celebratory tone, affirming the divinity of Christ and the completion of his ministry on earth.</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_peraklitos">Peraklitos (Pentecost)</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_peraklitos_history">Peraklitos, meaning "Comforter" or "Advocate," is the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo name for Pentecost. Celebrated 50 days after Fasika, it commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus Christ, marking the foundation of the Christian Church. It is one of the nine major feast days of the Lord.</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_peraklitos_celebration">The day is observed with great reverence, including special prayers and liturgies that reflect on the power of the Holy Spirit to guide and empower the faithful. Traditionally, the faithful wear new or clean white garments, symbolizing purity and the fresh spiritual start provided by the Holy Spirit.</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_nineveh">Nineveh</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_nineveh_history">The Fast of Nineveh, or Tsome Nenewe, is a three-day fast observed by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church approximately two weeks before the start of the Great Lent. It commemorates the preaching of Jonah the Prophet to the people of Nineveh and their subsequent repentance, saving the city from destruction. It serves as a spiritual precursor to the main Lenten period.</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_nineveh_celebration">The fast is one of the seven official fasts of the church and, like the Great Lent, requires abstinence from meat and dairy products. During these three days, devout members attend church services and engage in intensified prayer and repentance, mirroring the biblical city of Nineveh\'s submission to God\'s word.</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_abiy_tsom">Abiy Tsom (Great Lent)</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_abiy_tsom_history">Abiy Tsom, meaning the "Great Fast" or "Great Lent," is the longest and most revered fasting season in the Ethiopian Orthodox calendar, lasting 55 days. It is also known as Hudade or Tsome Arbaa, the forty-day fast of Jesus in the wilderness. It begins on a Monday and concludes with Fasika (Easter) and is a period of intense spiritual preparation.</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_abiy_tsom_celebration">The fast is exceptionally rigorous, requiring abstinence from meat, eggs, and dairy products for the entire 55 days. Devout followers also adhere to a strict vegan diet, avoiding all animal products. Beyond diet, the fast involves increased prayer, almsgiving, and repentance, preparing the faithful to spiritually participate in Christ\'s passion and resurrection.</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_debre_zeit">Debre Zeit (Mount of Olives)</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_debre_zeit_history">Debre Zeit, meaning the "Mount of Olives," is a festival celebrated on the second Sunday of the Great Lent. It commemorates the prophecy and teachings of Jesus Christ given on the Mount of Olives, particularly concerning the signs of his Second Coming and the end times. The day encourages reflection on vigilance and preparedness for judgment.</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_debre_zeit_celebration">The liturgy for this day focuses heavily on the Gospel readings that detail Christ\'s apocalyptic discourses. The theme of Debre Zeit is one of spiritual alertness, urging the faithful to remain steadfast in their faith and good works, using the Lenten season as a time to correct their paths.</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_hosanna">Hosanna (Palm Sunday)</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_hosanna_history">Hosanna, or Palm Sunday, is celebrated on the Sunday immediately preceding Fasika (Easter). It commemorates the triumphant entry of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem, where crowds laid palms and cloaks on the road and hailed him with cries of "Hosanna," a Hebrew word meaning "save now" or "save, please."</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_hosanna_celebration">On this day, palm fronds or braided leaves are distributed to the faithful in church, which are often woven into rings or crosses, and kept as a reminder of Christ\'s sacrifice and victory. The day marks the beginning of Holy Week, the final week of the Great Lent, which details Christ\'s Passion.</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_rikbe_kahinat">Rikbe Kahinat (Congress of Priests)</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_rikbe_kahinat_history">Rikbe Kahinat, meaning the "Congress of Priests," is an observance that traditionally begins on Wednesday of the Holy Week, the final week leading up to Fasika. It is a day of deep reflection on the betrayal of Jesus by Judas Iscariot and the subsequent assembly of the priests and elders who condemned him.</string>
    <string name="holiday_orthodox_rikbe_kahinat_celebration">The liturgical focus of Rikbe Kahinat centers on the sorrowful events of Christ\'s passion, highlighting the moral failings of those who plotted against him. The day is observed with heightened fasting and extended church services that prepare the faithful for the upcoming solemnity of Siklet (Good Friday).</string>
